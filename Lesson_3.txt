When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When more than one person is working on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maintain control over what is pulled from the remote if there are multiple users operating on the same repository
